Console calculator implementation based on Polish reverse notation. Works in two modes: standard and engineering.
Operations are provided: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplying (*), division (/)
(all - both in standard and engineering modes),
raising to a power (^), rooting (root), sin, cos, tan (all - only in engineering mode).
All members of the input expression (operators, arguments, brackets) must be separated by spaces, i.e.:
( 2 + 012.2235 * sin 124 + cos 745 ) ^ 4 / 5.25 * 033.789 - ( 789.41 * 0.56 + tan 200 ) root 1.23.
